    "The CRUD chemical plant produces as part of its production process a noxious compound called chemical X. Chemical X is highly toxic and needs to be disposed of properly. Fortunately, CRUD is linked by a pipe system to the FRESHAIR recycling plant that can safely reprocess chemical X. On any given day, the CRUD plant will produce the following amount of chemical X (the plant operates between 9am and 3pm only):\n",

    "Becuase of environmental regulation, at no point in time is the CRUD plant allowed to keep more than 1000 litres on site and no chemical X is allowed to be kept overnight.
