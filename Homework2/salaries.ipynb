    "The director of Awesome Tech startup needs to decide what salaries to offer its employees for the coming year. In order to keep the employees satisfied, she needs to satisfy the following constraints:\n",

    "- Peter, Nina, and Samir each want to be paid at least $8000 more than Tom\n",

    "- Linda wants her salary to be $500 more than Gary\n",

    "- IT professionals: This group consists of Tom, Peter, Nina, and Samir\n",
    "- Customer Service representatives: This is the rest of the employees\n",

    "Instead of minimizing the original objective, we instead want to minimize:\n",
    "- the largest IT professional salary + the largest customer service representative salary\n",
    "\n",
    "The employees demands for salaries must still be satisfied. Note that this problem is a min-max problem and should be reformulated using the epigraph form discussed in class."
