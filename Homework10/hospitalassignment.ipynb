    "Every year, a new set of recent medical school graduates need to begin their residency at a hospital. Due to the prestige of certain hospitals, it is generally impossible for all recent graduates to begin residency at their first choice. In order to facilitate a fair assignment process, where each graduate is matched with one hospital, the graduates are usually asked to fill out a preference list, ranking each of the hospitals. Graduates are then matched to hospitals by solving an assignment problem (a balanced transportation problem) where the preferences of the graduates are used to define the costs in the objective function, which we minimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the case where there are 3 hospitals and 4 people. Then, each person rates one hospital as 1 (their first choice), one hospital as 2, and one hospital as 3. An example preference list would be, where each row is a person and each column is a hospital.\n",

    "Here, the first person's first preference is hospital 2, their second preference is hospital 1 and their third preference is hospital 3. Our goal is to satisfy these preferences in the \"best\" way possible. However, what is \"best\" is not always clear. Should we maximize the number of people who get their first choice? Or minimize the number that get their third choice? We can get different solutions that favor one approach versus the other by varying how we use these preferences to define the objective function. For example, if we simply use these preferences as the costs (so if person A gets assigned to their first choice, that incurs a cost of 1, their second choice incurs a cost of 2, and their third choice incurs a cost of 3). However, we may get a very different assignment if we use the square of these preferences as the costs (so if person A gets assigned to their first choice, that incurs a cost of 1, their second choice incurs a cost of 4, and their third choice incurs a cost of 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework assignment, you will start from **the code in this notebook**. The code inside of the first code block of the notebook generates an example of the hospital assignment problem with 100 people and 5 hospitals. You do not need to modify this block. You will solve this problem 4 times, raising the preference list to the powers 1/4, 1, 2, and 4, as is set up in the second code block. In this second block, you should put the variables and constraints of your model prior to the loop. Inside the loop, you should create the objective function based on the power the preference list is raised to (using the variable preferences defined in there). Then, update the line of code just below optimize!(m) with the name of your decision variable (which should be indexed over [people (1-100), hospitals (1-5)]).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should formulate this problem as a balanced transportation problem, where each person is assigned to one hospital (provides 1 supply) and each hospital is assigned 20 people (has a demand of 20). Due to the size of this problem, constructing an incidence matrix is a bit unweildy, so you should use the transportation problem form found in Applications\\_Transportation slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "If done properly, the rest of the code will compile the data from the solutions and the third code block will plot the 4 different solutions. **Finally, in Markdown below the final code cell, you should add a brief discussion of which solution you think is \"best\" and why.**"
